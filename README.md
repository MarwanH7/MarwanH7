👋 Hi, I’m @MarwanH7!

👀 I recently graduated with a degree in Electrical Engineering and Data Science. My interests revolve around the expansive world of data—from ETL processes to classical ML and Deep Learning. I'm particularly drawn to how these fields innovatively address business challenges in today's economy. My academic journey has also delved into Electricity, Economics, Philosophy, and Music.

🌱 Currently, I'm immersed in an exciting MLOps project. The goal? Taking functional ML models from notebooks and transforming them into practical, reproducible, monitorable, and deployable services.

💞️ I’m eager to collaborate on projects that contribute to a better planet and improved lives for people worldwide!
